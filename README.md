# Part 01 – Introduction to Java

This part introduces the basics of Java programming. The goal is to become familiar with the Java syntax, input/output, and basic control flow.

## 💡 Topics Covered

- Printing text using `System.out.println`
- Writing simple Java programs inside the `main` method
- Using variables and assigning values
- Reading user input with `Scanner`
- Working with different data types: `String`, `int`, `double`, `boolean`
- Basic conditional logic with `if` statements
- Using the `%` operator to check even/odd numbers
- String comparisons with `.equals()`

## 🧪 Example Exercises

- Print a custom message (e.g., "Ada Lovelace")
- Ask for the user's name and greet them
- Repeat a message multiple times
- Check whether a number is even or odd
- Determine whether a year is a leap year
- Validate age inputs and calculate taxes

## 📁 Structure

Each Java file in this folder is a small independent exercise.  
The files are named according to the task (e.g., `EvenOrOdd.java`, `LeapYear.java`).

---

✅ **Goal:** Build a strong foundation in writing and understanding simple Java programs before moving on to loops, methods, and more complex logic.

## Part 02 – Methods, Loops, and Modular Programming
This part dives deeper into Java programming by introducing methods, loops, and parameterized programming. You’ll learn how to organize code into reusable units and use iteration for repeated actions.

## 💡 Topics Covered
Writing and calling methods

Parameters and return values

Using while and for loops

Loop control: break, continue

Method reusability and modularization

Printing shapes and patterns using loops

Using Math methods (e.g., Math.sqrt)

Nested method calls and method chaining

## 🧪 Example Exercises
Write and reuse a method that prints a line of text

Print numbers in increasing or decreasing order using loops

Calculate a sum or factorial using a method

Determine the smallest or greatest number using parameters

Use one method inside another (e.g., sum() inside average())

Print star patterns like squares, rectangles, triangles, and a Christmas tree

Divide two numbers and return a floating-point result

Print only numbers divisible by 3 in a given range

## 🔁 Emphasis on Loops and Repetition
This part builds fluency with repetition and modular thinking:

Looping over ranges with conditions

Printing structured output (like triangles and trees)

Avoiding repetition by calling methods multiple times

Using helper methods to simplify logic

## 📁 Structure
Each .java file represents a focused task or concept.

Exercises are grouped by themes (e.g., loops, methods, conditionals).

Filenames reflect the content: e.g., Greatest.java, PrintTriangle.java, DivisibleByThree.java.

## ✅ Goal
To strengthen your understanding of methods and loops, and to encourage modular code design. By the end of Part 2, you should be comfortable writing programs with reusable methods, input/output, and structured logic using loops.
