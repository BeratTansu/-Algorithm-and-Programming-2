# Part 01 – Introduction to Java

This part introduces the basics of Java programming. The goal is to become familiar with the Java syntax, input/output, and basic control flow.

## 💡 Topics Covered

- Printing text using `System.out.println`
- Writing simple Java programs inside the `main` method
- Using variables and assigning values
- Reading user input with `Scanner`
- Working with different data types: `String`, `int`, `double`, `boolean`
- Basic conditional logic with `if` statements
- Using the `%` operator to check even/odd numbers
- String comparisons with `.equals()`

## 🧪 Example Exercises

- Print a custom message (e.g., "Ada Lovelace")
- Ask for the user's name and greet them
- Repeat a message multiple times
- Check whether a number is even or odd
- Determine whether a year is a leap year
- Validate age inputs and calculate taxes

## 📁 Structure

Each Java file in this folder is a small independent exercise.  
The files are named according to the task (e.g., `EvenOrOdd.java`, `LeapYear.java`).

✅ **Goal:** Build a strong foundation in writing and understanding simple Java programs before moving on to loops, methods, and more complex logic.
